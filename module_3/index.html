        <p>WrestleMania 36 is the upcoming 36th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view and WWE Network event produced by WWE for their Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brand divisions — the first to promote the NXT brand. It was taped on March 25
            and 26, 2020 and will air on pay-per-view and the WWE Network on April 4 and 5. Originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020 at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa and to air live, WrestleMania 36 was relocated due to the 2019–20
            coronavirus pandemic. The promotion announced plans to present the event from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando (where all other WWE programming has since originated), and other unannounced locations, each with no spectators in attendance,
            and for it to be the first WrestleMania to be broadcast across two nights and the second to be aired from multiple venues</p>
